# CodeTether Brand Messaging

## Positioning statement
CodeTether is the production-ready, A2A protocol-native coordination platform that turns AI agents into reliable systems. It connects any model to any tool via MCP, orchestrates multi-agent workflows, and uses RLM to process massive contexts so agents can deliver real outputs through distributed workers.

## One-liner
Turn AI agents into production systems.

## Tagline options
- Production A2A coordination for AI agent teams
- The AI worker for real-world tasks and outputs
- Orchestrate agents. Ship results.
- Unlimited context, reliable outputs.

## Brand narrative
AI agents are powerful, but most deployments stop at chat. CodeTether provides the missing coordination layer: A2A-native messaging, MCP tool access, and a secure distributed runtime so agents can run long tasks, handle huge contexts, and deliver artifacts you can actually use. RLM is the engine that keeps quality high as inputs scale, breaking problems down, processing recursively, and reassembling verified results. It is open source, production ready, and designed for teams that want outcomes, not demos.

## Core pillars
- A2A-native orchestration: standard protocol messaging, discovery, and routing
- MCP tool integration: connect 100+ tools and your internal systems
- Distributed worker architecture: run agents where your data lives
- RLM for long context: recursive processing for massive repos and documents
- Production ops: streaming, observability, and enterprise security controls

## Differentiators
- Standards-first: A2A + MCP for interoperability and zero lock-in
- Results, not replies: deliver CSV, PDF, code, and reports
- Secure execution: control-plane and data-plane separation with workers
- Built for scale: Docker, Helm, and horizontal scaling from day one

## Proof points
- Official A2A Protocol v0.3 compliance via the Google a2a-sdk
- Open source under Apache 2.0
- Production deployment at `https://api.codetether.run`
- 100+ MCP tools supported
- 10M+ token contexts via RLM
- Voice agent support via LiveKit

## Primary audiences
- Platform and AI engineering teams shipping agent systems
- Automation builders using Zapier, n8n, or webhooks
- Enterprises that need governance, auditability, and data residency

## High-impact use cases
- Multi-agent workflows for analysis, planning, and execution
- AI coding agents for refactors, tests, and documentation
- Long-context research across large codebases and datasets
- Background task automation with file outputs and callbacks
- Voice-enabled agent sessions and real-time streaming

### Short description (60-90 chars)
Production A2A coordination platform for AI agent teams.

### Short bio (140-180 chars)
CodeTether is the A2A-native platform for orchestrating AI agents with MCP tool access, distributed workers, and real outputs you can ship.

### Long bio (300-500 chars)
CodeTether turns AI agents into production systems. It is a standards-first A2A coordination layer with MCP tool access, distributed workers, and long-context RLM processing. Orchestrate multi-agent workflows, run tasks where your data lives, and deliver real outputs like CSV, PDF, and code. Open source, production ready, and built to scale.

## RLM explainer
RLM (Recursive Language Models) is how CodeTether handles huge contexts without quality collapse.
- Decompose: split massive inputs into tractable chunks
- Process: run focused sub-LLM analysis per chunk
- Synthesize: reassemble, verify, and deliver a single coherent result

## Voice and tone
- Confident and technical, but clear and practical
- Outcome-focused: emphasize delivery, reliability, and scale
- Standards-first: highlight A2A and MCP as the foundation
- No hype: be direct about what the platform enables
