"""CodeTether agent worker package.

DEPRECATED: The Python worker (agent_worker/worker.py) is replaced by the
codetether Rust binary's built-in A2A worker mode:

    codetether a2a --server https://api.codetether.run --auto-approve all

See: agent_worker/install-codetether-worker.sh for systemd installation.
